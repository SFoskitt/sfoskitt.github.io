Today I setup a Python websocket server.  This is technically for a work project so not 100% compliant with the rules of the 100 Days of Code challenge.  However, I’m confident this satisfies the spirit of the challenge as I’m still very new to Python and we don’t use it anywhere in our app at work.  Yay!

So the gist is, there is a Python dependency called Tornado which has great built in methods to run a regular http server and a websocket server (and probably other goodies I didn’t get to today).  I confirmed the server works by running an html client in the browser.
