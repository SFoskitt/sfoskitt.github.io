Switching things up a bit.  Still working on some Python exercises, but I've switched over to [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) exercises.  These are sweet.  They come with tests/specs so I'm getting some experience with that too.  TDD - YAY!

Here is my Exercism work pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/):

And I've done some work on these in the past, in JavaScript, so I'll push those later.
