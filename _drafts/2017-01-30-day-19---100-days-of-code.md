Despite my intention, I strayed away from the plan to go back to [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) exercises.  I tried (and failed) to get a Python Flask application deployed to Heroku.  :-(  This took much longer than an hour.  I'm calling it a fail.

So, instead, I'll stick with tried-and-true ["46 Simple Python Exercises"](http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html) - now with Pytest tests!
