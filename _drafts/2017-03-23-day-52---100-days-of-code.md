## CSS is a mess

Or at least that has been my opinion for a couple years.  I have a terrible habit of dismissing things I don't care for or don't get right away (or which just I find far too fiddly).  CSS has been high on that list for a long time.  However, in light of recent circumstances (unemployment, time on my hands) I'm committed to turning that around.  Tonight I spent a couple hours playing around with CSS in a no-pressure way.  I looked at vanilla CSS, Bootstrap CSS, and PureCSS.  I'm not entirely through with this yet, but definitely made a small bit of progress.  Ultimately, I'd like to complete the same layout on three identical pages using these three CSS techniques so I can understand the basics of vanilla CSS and the abstraction of Bootstrap and PureCSS.

Thanks for watching, tune in tomorrow when I go off plan and tackle this project again.
