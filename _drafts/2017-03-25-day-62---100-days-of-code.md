## More CSS fatasticity (made that up)

Earlier today I spoke to a recruiter in response to an application I submitted for a Front End Developer position.  The company wants to test my chops on HTML and CSS.  Wow.  Is the universe spying on me?  Is this a huge coincidence or karma at work?

My night was consumed with this project.  I suspect this took me longer than the typical FED candidate as it is my weakest subject.  I did not finish this tonight, I will work on it again tomorrow.  I promised the recruiter to have it done before lunch tomorrow.  Plenty of time!  (yikes)
