## Another code challenge

And another face plant.  

Today I was given an opportunity to fix some broken code as part of a code challenge for unnamed company.  The instructions for the challenge were the first hurdle.  I looked at the code, looked at the instructions, studied the code, studied the instructions, et. al. for more than half an hour before I finally understood what was being asked.  Blerg.

The recruiter suggested it takes most people an hour to finish this.  Ha ha.  I would like to meet these people who take an hour or less to do this particular challenge and I would like them to please mentor me and please tell me what am I seriously doing wrong!

Anyway, on to other things.  I'm doing more problems on HackerRank, working through the Algorithm exercises.  Not as fun as CodeWars because the input is coming from a server instead of some Jasmine tests, so I can't see the input.  This makes debugging on HackerRank harder.

Later taters, it's time to sign off.
