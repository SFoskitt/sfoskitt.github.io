And I'm making it kind of easy on myself today because I left it for the last thing.

I host a bi-weekly Python meetup.  The group and I are following along with the e-book ["Learn Python the Hard Way"](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed Shaw.  There are at least two weeks between each meeting, and so far at each one I can barely remember what we learned the meeting before.

I'm committed this year to make a greater effort at learning by taking notes and using Anki for spaced repetition learning.  Today I finally went back through the 20 exercises and added notes.

For purposes of this 100 Days challenge, these notes are also in a repository on my GitHub account here: ["Learn Python the Hard Way"](https://github.com/SFoskitt/Learn-Python-the-Hard-Way)

When we finish with all the lessons in the book, I imagine the Anki deck will be useful to others as well.  I'll keep you updated and let you all know when this might be available and where to find it.
