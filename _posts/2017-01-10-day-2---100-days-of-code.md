Today was my bi-weekly Meetup of "Learn Python the Hard Way".  It went swimmingly!

At this meetup we cruised through Chapters 21, 22, and 25.  Chapters 23 and 24 are long-form exercises and we all agreed we would do this.

In addition to the chapters, we worked on a problem on [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/).  That was a bit of a challenge.

Overall today my total non-work coding time is an hour and a half!  And it was fun because it was work done with others.  This meetup is an recurring event on the calendar of our local Los Angeles chapter of [Women Who Code](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-LA/), so there were a few of us learning Python tonight.
