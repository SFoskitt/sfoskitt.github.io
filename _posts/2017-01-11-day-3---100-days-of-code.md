It's starting to hurt, just a little bit.

On days when there is nothing going on after work, this one hour (and time for subsequent documentation) is almost effortless and a little fun.  However, on those days for which I have plans after work *and* must still squeeze in an hour of non-work coding, this is making late nights.  And today I'm tired.  This is probably why it's called a "challenge" and not "piece of piss"?

Today's non-work coding happened during work.  Sorry, Company.  My dance card is full this evening and I'd like to be in bed before 11:00 pm tonight.

I took notes today on the Python exercises we did last night during our meetup.  The GitHub repository for this is updated [here](https://github.com/SFoskitt/Learn-Python-the-Hard-Way).  Additionally, there was a [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/) problem that we couldn't solve so I worked on that some more.  

I thought it would be cool to do some kind of scheduling for this challenge, or at least show a list of what I plan to work on during this challenge.  But as it turns out there is a TON of stuff to potentially do and I couldn't find a way to prioritize any one project over another, so I'll do these in the order that strikes my fancy the hardest.

Okay, that's it for today and I'm ready for a nap!
