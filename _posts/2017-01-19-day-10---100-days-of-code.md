And we’re back to taking notes again on Python.  Today I finally finished Exercise 22 by going back through the previous exercises and note all the new stuff.  Done!  And just in time too, as my next Python meetup is Tuesday next week.

For a refresher, here is Exercise 22 on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/SFoskitt/Learn-Python-the-Hard-Way/blob/master/Exercise22.md).


My actual chapter notes are also in that repository, previously all on one Readme.md file.  These are now broken up into [separate files here](https://github.com/SFoskitt/Learn-Python-the-Hard-Way).

If there’s time this evening (probable) and I’m feeling motivated (less probable) then I’ll also do some of those Python exercises I found the other day.  Whee!  


If this #100DaysOfCode is news to you, here’s day #1 with more information:
