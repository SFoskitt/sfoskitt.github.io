Back on track today with some Python problems from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard).

And a huge realization.  Spending my hour of code taking notes has been useful for general memory retention.  However, after today's hour of code I definitely accept what others have been saying - the only way to get better coding is to code more.  Seems obvious, right?  But I thought for sure supplementing the activity of coding with study of the programming language itself would help.  Yeah, it may help understand the function of the language better, but it certainly doesn't help when it comes to hammering out solutions.

This is the type of realization this challenged was designed to produce.  Yay!
