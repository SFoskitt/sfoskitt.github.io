Really loving these exercises in Python [here](http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html).  They're not super easy, I have had to look some stuff up.  But they're not "head-bashing" hard either.  So far, not too bad.  

Today I finished three more exercises from this website.  These are now loaded up to the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/SFoskitt/python_extra).  Today's are these:

* 05_translate.py
* 06_sum.py
* 07_reverse\_string.py

Okay - so you'll probably notice that, unlike my promise yesterday, none of this has to do with updating (prettifying) this blog.  Yeah, that's a long story that has to do with upgrading Ghost on Digital Ocean.  It was an odyssey and maybe I'll write about that some day.  Just keeping it simple today, coding exercises and nothing more.
