Nothing monumental today; just some good, solid coding exercises from the ["46 Simple Python Exercises"](http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html).  I finished exercise 10 from yesterday, which was a lot easier on the second day.  The following three new exercises were also not easy, but very satisfying.

To be fair, I took longer than an hour to do these.
