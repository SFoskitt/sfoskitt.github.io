Today I worked on more of the "46 Simple Python Exercises" and noticed that to complete these, I could have imported work from previous exercises.  These are starting to build on each other.  But the previous work was pretty simple and easier to replicate than import.  Oh well.  I know how to do this, but prefer to keep these simple.
