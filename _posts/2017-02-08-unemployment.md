Unemployment sucks and involuntary layoff can shred your self-esteem.  Trust me, from first hand experience, I know this.  

You may have noticed this blog post is dated a full week after the last one.  That’s because my layoff day was Thursday last week.  It knocked the wind out of me and I spent the next couple days wallowing.  Saturday evening I brushed off my resume.  Sunday I posted the resume to a couple sites, applied for a few jobs, and watched Superbowl LI.  Monday was a flurry of activity as I responded to emails, LinkedIn messages, phone calls, and generally volleyed back any initial interest in my updated resume.  Tuesday (yesterday) I was out meeting with recruiters and had my first phone interview.  Which leads us to today.

Today I get back into the rhythm of a daily task.  Despite being a challenge, and genuinely challenging sometimes, there was a small comfort in having this one, consistent thing going on in my life every single day.  I’m looking forward to picking up this thread.
