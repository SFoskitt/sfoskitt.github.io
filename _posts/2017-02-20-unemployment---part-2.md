It's two and a half weeks since I was laid off.  One of those weeks was dedicated to a family visit planned several months ago.  This week the job search is firing up again and I'm feeling encouraged by all the listings I've seen.  Recruiters have been helpful as well.

One thing different about this job search from the last time I did this: the ratio of companies looking for React experience is higher than those looking for Angular experience.  What does that mean for an Angular developer?  It means she will buffer her GitHub profile with some React projects, of course.  Let's get this party started.

Where can I start with React?  Tomorrow I'll start a to-do list project.  Lately it seems to be the 21st century equivalent of 'Hello, World!'.
