## Let’s do this again
### MRW a month goes by without blogging

Unemployment.

For the third time in a row, I’ll start a blog post with the foremost thing on my mind: having no job.  Most well-meaning people will say “Finding a job is a full-time job”.  And I don’t dispute that at all.  Refreshing skills and knowledge in preparation for the next interview, scouring listings for potential roles, crafting outstanding cover letters for each one, and maintaining self-care routines - on a daily basis these are all things that will take a bite out of 24 hours in a day.  It’s actually more exhausting than a job because there is the constant strain of wondering “is this enough, should I be doing more”.

For me, it’s not enough.  Here’s my more.

While I was working, the 100 Days of Code challenge was meant to stretch my skills beyond the day-to-day stuff I was doing for my employer.  With no employer, and no day-to-day coding obligations, I’m finding the access to accountability limited.  There’s no daily scrum, no stand-up.  There’s no sprint deadline.  There’s no one out there waiting for me to produce something.  And - truthfully - if it’s left up to me, I would sit on my lumpy butt all day and watch Netflix.  Really.

So, in addition to the usual stuff unemployed people do to find a new role, I’m going to do this.  I need to do this.  It’s way over due, past time to do more than a toy problem or two every day.

Today is blog and setup day.  Tomorrow there is a long interview in the middle of the day (prep, commute, sweat, answer questions, sweat, commute).  Friday will be Day 1 of my newest 100 Days of Code Challenge.
