### Reboot Day 2
## React is silky smooth

Today's #100DaysOfCode is a small improvement on my React Todo List.  Although, after today's "improvement" this is no longer a list of todo tasks.  I found a delightful public API which provides multiple quiz questions in many subjects, in either multiple choice or true/false.  I've used this only to test the fetch() method in my App.js file to see if I could get it to work for data outside my app.  And - hey - like magic, it's working.  So if you view this app before I change it later, you'll see the question portion of five of these quiz questions.  If you didn't get it yesterday, the link is [HERE](https://young-brook-78040.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Tomorrow I may, or may not, try this fetch() method with Checkvist and some Basic Authorization.  Whoopee!
