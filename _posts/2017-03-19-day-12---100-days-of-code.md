## Tons and Tons of CodeWars Problems...

...is what I did today.

Dear Team Stephanie,

If you've been following along, you know this blog (and the 100 Days of Code Challenge for me) have experienced a stutter-step lately.  Unlimited unstructured time on my hands has led me astray.

Today I spent a lot of time working on problems from CodeWars. So. Fun.  It's back-to-basics, no-long-term-commitment, fun.  Today was all JavaScript, all the time. 

This gal requires a plan.  Here's a plan.

Tomorrow (Monday): 
- tinker with the React app to get Basic Authorization working with Checkvist

Tuesday:
- two new problems on HackerRank

Wednesday:
- add new CSS to the React app (right now it's the basic stuff from create-react-app)

Thursday:
- two new problems on CodeWars

Friday:
- anything Python related (my second love)

That is a great start.  Plans can be broken, but we'll see, hopefully not.  :-)
