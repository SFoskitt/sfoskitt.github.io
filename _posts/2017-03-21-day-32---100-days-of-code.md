## HackerRank is our friend

Today's plan was to complete at least two problems on HackerRank.  Easy to do when I was given an assessment set (coincidentally) on HackerRank.  I'm totally countint those problems toward today's 100 Days challenge.  Done and done.

The assessment included three problems, two easy and one medium.  Following that I finished two more on my own profile.

Overall, pretty happy with following a plan for this challenge.  I'm done with this and will tonight poke some more at the issue with my React app.
