## CSS is catching like a virus

This evening I spent almost an hour playing around with styles on my React app.  It looks cute, but not cohesive in any sort of way.  I am not a designer, but will try to perk it up a bit more in the future.  At least now it looks like someone gave a damn and put a tiny bit of effort into it.

Tomorrow is problems in CodeWars and it should be fun, fun, fun.  If there's time left over I'll add Express to the React app and some CORS headers to get the Checkvist API working for me.
