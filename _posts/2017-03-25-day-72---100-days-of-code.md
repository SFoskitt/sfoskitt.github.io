## And a code challenge is submitted

Yesterday I was emailed a code challenge.  "Using only HTML and CSS, recreate this site."  Yikes.  I worked on in for most of the evening yesterday, and a few hours this morning.  Then turned it in with much trepidation.  My result does *not* look identical to the reference site.  But it looks pretty close.  Let the chips fall where they may.

Later this afternoon I re-created a code challenge I encountered recently.  Something along the line of "mutate this string following these rules".  That was fun, and not surprisingly it was much easier to do the second time around, at home, on my own computer, with no spectators.  Oh well.  Maybe Karma will pay me twice and present me with this same challenge at another company.
