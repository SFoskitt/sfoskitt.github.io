Hello, Friends -

Day 4, you say? Leetcode, I say.

And I randomly got an easy one - "is this number a palindrome". I think it is LC#9. The solution is straight-forward if you convert it to a string. The real test is figuring this out *without* first converting it to a string. Friends, let me tell you, the math on that is brain bending. I'll take a look at a couple other mathematical solutions before trying this because on first glance it didn't make sense to me.

What's on tap for tomorrow?

Tomorrow, Friday, and this weekend are going to be busy with family things. It's the annual family gathering at our home base. Four of us converge from three different parts of the country onto our parents' house and we celebrate birthdays. This year we have an aunt turning 90!

So, for purposes of this blog, I will code an hour each day but it will continue being discrete one-off problems like N-Queens or Leetcode. However, starting next week, I'd like to take you on an adventure with me. I have plans to do something big and I'm kind of excited! See you tomorrow.
