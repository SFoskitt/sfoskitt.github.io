Hello, Friends -

As promised, today's coding time was spent rewriting/obfuscating a good chunk of code I wrote two companies ago. At this point the single doc is obfuscated and all company references removed. However, it does not work. At all. But here are the plans:
1. add some TSParticle - confetti
2. add some generic HTML pages to get the RulesEngine to work
3. maybe add some of the missing utils, though I think most aren't necessary

I'm holding on to this project for a little while. Tomorrow is going to be another very big family day, and so it's another Leetcode day. Sorry. I love digging into these kinds of projects. And working with JavaScript and HTML brings me back to my roots. As much as I would love to keep working on this today, I have family things the rest of the day today and all day tomorrow.

Thanks for sticking around! See you later!
