Hello, Friends -

As mentioned, today was a very long drive home - ten hours plus extra time due to construction slow down (soooo much construction). The Leetcode problem was going to be 3Sum "three sum" - LC #15. This is an extension of the 2Sum "two sum" problem - LC #1.

I looked at my solution for LC #1, done years ago. And it looked like a brute force approach. So I refactored that using a hashmap which reduced the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n). One of the clues to 3Sum is something like "2Sum solution plus extra". I'm looking forward to doing this one.

However, given the long day, my brain is mush and the LC #1 refactor was as much as I could handle. Was it an hour today? Heck, no. But given how much extra time I've spent coding this past week I feel okay aobut it because the time should still work out to more than an hour a day average, and I have definitely spent time coding every day.

Until tomorrow...
