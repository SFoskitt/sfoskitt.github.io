Hello, Friends -

Despite my best effort, I did not start a fun long-term project as planned today. The day started early with a doctor's appointment that lasted four hours. Then there was a trip to the grocery store. It may or may not surprise you to know it takes an hour to buy all the groceries required to restock a kitchen after a two week absence. After parking the car and hauling and unloading all the groceries, I decided to take it easy.

Here is the "easy" I chose today: Leetcode #15 - 3Sum. This is the problem I was supposed to do last night but ended up only refactoring my solution to Leectode #1 - 2Sum. One of the hints for 3Sum is something like "use 2Sum".

I'm testing my git push ability from this other latop. Let's see if it works before I finish writing this post.
