Hello, Friends -

Despite my best effort, I did not start a fun long-term project as planned today. The day started early with a doctor's appointment that lasted four hours. Then there was a trip to the grocery store. It may or may not surprise you to know it takes an hour to buy all the groceries required to restock a kitchen after a two week absence. After parking the car and hauling and unloading all the groceries, I decided to take it easy.

Here is the "easy" I chose today: Leetcode #15 - 3Sum. This is the problem I was supposed to do last night but ended up only refactoring my solution to Leectode #1 - 2Sum. One of the hints for 3Sum is something like "use 2Sum".

The hints on this problem were okay - helpful but not SUPER helpful. It took me a little bit to get to a working solution. And to be honest I don't think I like my solution. It's not optimal. She works, but she ain't pretty. I had hoped to get to better than (O)n^2 but nope - not this time. I've added this problem, and all the Leetcode problems I've worked on so far, into a new repo. Also, I think I'll switch to HackerRank problems for a while because over there I can add my own test cases.

Anyway, tomorrow is the day to launch the "big project". Stay tuned!
