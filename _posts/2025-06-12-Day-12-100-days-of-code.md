Hello, Friends -

How it started: Today I will flesh out the bones of the Terraform code for the serverless application and event grid trigger.

How it's going: An hour later and I'm literally no closer. The Terraform registry docs on Azure functions, specifically azurerm_linux_function_app and azurerm_windows_function_app, do not offer clues to any kind of trigger. There is a "schedule" field on the "backup" block in these Terraform resources but nothing comparable for the function itself. My Google-foo was very off today because the relevant search terms return irrelevant results and tangent topics. At the end of the hour I shut down everything and tried this: "azure how to trigger function automatically with timer". Apparently this hapens with some annotation in the Java code and not in the Azure infrastructure itself. WHY?? It appears that this will set up a situation where the only way to test or debug this is by modifying the code - no manual adjustments.

Friends, it's been rough today and I'm giving myself a pass.
