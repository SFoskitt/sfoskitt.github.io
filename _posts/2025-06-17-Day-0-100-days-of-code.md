Hello, Friends -

It's a 100 days challenge. And I've missed a few days - several days, in fact. How does one address missing days when the intention is to proceed with a habit uninterrupted? *sigh*

So this is "starting over again" agin. Yes, here we are. There are no excuses, unfortunately, for missing days in this iteration of my 100 Days challenge. I wish there were. But then the question is: even if there were excuses, should one start over anyway? It may seem rigid and inflexible but continuing to build a chain of daily successes is kind of the point. And without the daily practice can it be considered a truly "100 Days"? My opinion is nope.

Taking a deep breath, recommitting to this project, here I go! Stay tuned...
