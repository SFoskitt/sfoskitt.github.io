Hello, Friends -

Day 1. See yesterday's "Day 0" for explanation.

Today my hour of code was spent completing an actual Amazon assessment for an actual job opportunity and it did *not* go well, unfortunately. Ouch. This one really knocked me back. So I have decided to go back to fundamentals. I'll be focusing primarily on coding problems - algorithms, data structures - for a while. You know, the good stuff.

What will this look like? A lot, lot more Leetcode and Hackerrank, and any other sources I can find (to be blogged about later).

Stay tuned...
