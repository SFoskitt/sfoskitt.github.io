Hello, Friends -

Welcome to Day 2. Coding problems and fun times ahead.

Today I spent my hour (hour plus) of code on HackerRank, switching things up from Leetcode. HackerRank allows users to enter their own custom test cases, which I lik. However, I'm now seeing their "easy" problems are kind of easy. But I also notice there is a primary difference - HackerRank starts the user with the basics of the language; Leetcode starts the user with the basics of algorithms and data structures. All of this is useful for me. I may bounce back and forth between them, we'll see.

Stay tuned...
