Hello, Friends -

Today I worked on [HackerRank Anagrams](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-anagrams/problem?isFullScreen=true). Two words: "straight-forward" and "not-tricky". LOL! Love that word count.

This problem requires one to determine if two strings are anagram of each other. This was made easiest by using Java Collections because there are built-in methods like `.sort` and `.equals` - hint hint.

Tomorrow I'll work on HackerRank String Tokens. Stay tuned...
