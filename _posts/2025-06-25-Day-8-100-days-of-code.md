Hello, Friends -

Today I worked on [HackerRank String Tokens](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-string-tokens/problem?isFullScreen=true). Given a string, return the number of alpha-only tokens and print them to console. This should be simple, given the right regular expression. However, I ran into issues. In fact, I had to write so many workarounds to pass the tests that I question whether there isn't a more elegant way to solve this. This is supposed to be the basis of test-driven development, I suppose. Anway.

Tomorrow I'll probably work on Java Generics. Stay tuned...
