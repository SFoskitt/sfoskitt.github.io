Hello, Friends -

Today I worked on [HackerRank Java Generics](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-generics/problem?isFullScreen=true). For a couple weeks now I've been working on HackerRank problems. And in every single one of these problems HackerRank sets up a skeleton function to be completed by the coder. And in the skeleton function the coder is expected to write the code needed to retrieve input from the console. Great. I've gotten so good at this that I can probably write it in my sleep:
```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
String str = sc.next();
int num = sc.nextInt();
sc.close();
```
However, in today's problem the coder was expected to already know - SOMEHOW - that this was not required in this problem. Man, I'm becoming disillusioned with HackerRank lately. Their problem descriptions are lacking sometimes and today was a perfect example of this. Disappointing. I'll consider going back to Leetcode, maybe starting tomorrow.

Tomorrow I'll work on ????  Stay tuned...
