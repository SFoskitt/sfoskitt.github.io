Hello, Friends -

My adventure in quantum computing is trucking along. Today I made it through about half of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuYz02clnx4). This covers IBM Qiskit Primitives, specifically Sampler primitives and Estimator primitives. The discussion was around how these are used to approach the IBM quantum platform. There are some good examples in here and I captured everything up to this point. I'm looking forward to finishing this tomorrow. Stay tuned...
