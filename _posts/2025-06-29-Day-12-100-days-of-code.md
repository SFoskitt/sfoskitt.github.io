Hello, Friends -

Last night I spent some time with Go for the first time. Special thanks to [this repo](https://github.com/furmanp/gitlab-activity-importer). I have a Gitlab instance running in Docker on my Synology NAS. Most of the non-work commits I made were to that Gitlab instance. This repo copies commits from Gitlab over to Github so that commit activity can be consolidated in my public Github profile. Sweet, eh? As this was my first experience with Go I didn't know what to expect but was very pleasantly surprised how east it is to read.

My adventure in quantum computing is trucking along. Today I made it through about half of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuYz02clnx4). This covers IBM Qiskit Primitives, specifically Sampler primitives and Estimator primitives. The discussion was around how these are used to approach the IBM quantum platform. There are some good examples in here and I captured everything up to this point. I'm looking forward to finishing this tomorrow. Stay tuned...
