Hello, Friends -

Today I detoured away from quantum. I'm marketing myself for my next role as a Java engineer with Spring-Boot experience - and I am that. However, it's been nine months since I last touched either professionally. And it behooves me to keep my skills sharp with extra training and exercises. So today I worked on a guided Spring-Boot project in Coursera, ["Spring Boot with Embedded Database"](https://www.coursera.org/programs/vts-learning-program-nvi2e/projects/spring-boot-embedded-db). This project focuses on embedded databases, which I haven't touched before; specifically [H2](https://h2database.com/). This went well and was pretty quick to complete. Unrelated to the code, I'm not sure I would take another guided project on Coursera. The VNC they use is well stocked with apps, but there were issues with the Eclipse version they installed there.

Tomorrow I may continue the Qiskit Primitives walk-through, or I may dive into another Coursera class. Stay tuned...
