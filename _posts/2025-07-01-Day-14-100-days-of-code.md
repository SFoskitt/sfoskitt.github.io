Hello, Friends -

Yesterday I thought I might either continue the Qiskit primitives walk-through or dive into a new Coursera Java-Spring course. Today I started ["Master Java Web Services and REST API with Spring Boot"](https://www.coursera.org/programs/vts-learning-program-nvi2e/learn/packt-master-java-web-services-and-rest-api-with-spring-boot-mxnmc). Thankfully it's not another guided project because their VNC is unfun.

This course starts by using the Spring initializer to download a fresh code project. The first module of this course is dependency injection with Spring framework. This is going well so far. I look forward to continuing this course.

Tomorrow I'll go back to Qiskit primitives because Monday is coming fast and I don't want to be behind before things start. Stay tuned...
