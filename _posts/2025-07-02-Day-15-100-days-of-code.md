Hello, Friends -

Today I completed this [Qiskit Primitives walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuYz02clnx4). There is a whole lot of information here and I did my best to take notes. And I captured the code samples here as well. These aren't going to be pertinent or relevant until next week when Qiskit Global Summer School (QGSS) starts.

Also, I continued [this Spring Boot course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/programs/vts-learning-program-nvi2e/learn/packt-master-java-web-services-and-rest-api-with-spring-boot-mxnmc). The topic was dependency injection in Spring framework. I wrote a few classes to demonstrate how Spring manages dependencies with annotations like @Component and @Autowired. So far I've completed Modules 1 through 3. Tomorrow I look forward to working on Module 4 which is another introduction to Spring but focusing on Web API development.

Stay tuned...
