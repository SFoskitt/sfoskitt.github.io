Hello, Friends -

Today I continued work on ["Master Java Web Services and REST API with Spring Boot"](https://www.coursera.org/programs/vts-learning-program-nvi2e/learn/packt-master-java-web-services-and-rest-api-with-spring-boot-mxnmc); specifically Module 4 focusing on Spring Boot Web API development.

Additionally I worked on [Leetcode problem #238](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description) which asks us to return an array with the product of all the other numbers in the input array EXCEPT array[i]. The additional restrictions on this are "don't use divide" and "complexity of O(n)". If we can use division then this is almost trivial. The solution is to iterate over the input array twice - once from left to right (index 0 to array.length) and then again from right to left (array.length to 0). I never would have considered this. Every solution I came up with violated one or both of the restrictions.

More to come, stay tuned...
