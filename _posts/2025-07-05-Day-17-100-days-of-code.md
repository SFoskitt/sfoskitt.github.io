Hello, Friends -

Today I eased back into #100DaysOfCode with two Leetcode problems.

[Leetcode #7](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/) "Reverse Integer" is labeled "medium" but with some java.lang built-in classes it was way easier than it should have been. I know Leetcode medium and hard problems are sometimes rough. Is it cheating to use Java classes (StringBuilder, Integer)? Or is this the wisdom of using the language tools available to me?

[Leetcode #10](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/) "Regular Expression Matching" is another surprisingly easy problem labeled "medium" with the implementation of Java classes (Pattern, Matcher). Was I supposed to do this iterating over a string and comparing characters? Pass, thanks, when there are built-in classes available to do this for me.

Tomorrow I'm planning to finish a Coursera Spring Boot module, number four out of eleven. It's going quickly. Thankfully my past experience with Spring has helped a lot here. In fact, most of my previous Spring knowledge was gleaned from working with the framework in many projects across two different companies. And working through these modules has helped connect the dots and fill in gaps in my knowledge. I'm enjoying it!

Stay tuned...
