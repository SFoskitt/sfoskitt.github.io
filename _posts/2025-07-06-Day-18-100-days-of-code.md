Hello, Friends -

Today I completed module four of eleven and started module five in the Coursera class [Master Java Web Services and REST API with Spring Boot](https://www.coursera.org/programs/vts-learning-program-nvi2e/learn/packt-master-java-web-services-and-rest-api-with-spring-boot-mxnmc). This is going well.

Tomorrow the 2025 Qiskit Global Summer School starts and I'm a little excited and a little nervous. In the past I wasn't able to dedicate as much time as I would have liked to the coursework because I had a job. It's not a graded course but there could be a certification if I can complete all the work. Things might go better this time, although I would have liked to spend more time on the pre-work. *sigh* That's the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.

Anyway, stay tuned...
