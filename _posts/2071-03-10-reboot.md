### Reboot This Mess

## If life were as simple as PC hardware

Today ends the second week in March.  Today was another job-free day and it's starting to get old.  Other than ABC (always be coding) I don't know what else to do for this, so f*** it.  Let's code.

You're familiar with the ultra-fantastic bootstrapper called create-react-app which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)?  If not, you're missing out.  Seriously.  Anyway, I have one of these spun up right now on Heroku [HERE](https://limitless-refuge-31886.herokuapp.com/).  Since then, I attended a fantastic local workshop by [Codemore](http://codemore.io/workshops.html) which touched on the basics of React, ReactDOM, and React Router (no Redux yet).  

I made a few changes to one of these project apps, customizing it slightly.  Ultimately it will connect with the open API of Checkvist and point to a dummy account I set up.  They use [Basic Authorization])(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) which is super-simple to implement.  But for today's [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.yn6s8d79r) my plan is much simpler - just get the project code deployed to a new Heroku app.  Simple, not always easy.  Catch you on the flip side.
