    <h2>O'Brien's Boat Tour</h2>
    <img src="/newfoundland/newfoundland-assets/IMG_20220516_120515096.jpg" width="100%" />
    <p>These are all the photos from the first trip on O'Brien's whale and puffin boat tour.</p>
    <p>This tour launches from Bay Bulls Harbor south of St. John's.  
        It goes east into the North Atlantic ocean toward a small island called Gull Rock.</p>

    <p>The puffins nest on this rock in the grassy parts at the top.  There is a species of sea gull that nests on the rocky parts at the bottom.</p>

    <p>There weren't too many puffins on the rock while we were circling, but there were plenty in the ocean getting lunch.</p>
    <p>Even without a whale to watch or puffins to peek, this was a terrific tour.  Living in a land-locked town it's incredibly rare
        to get time in a boat on the open ocean.  The rest of these photos are just lovely.

    <p>Somewhere in the grassy tufts of this photo there are adult puffins building their nests in anticipation of their single egg.</p>
